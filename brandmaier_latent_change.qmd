## Rationales of Longitudinal Research

1.  Direct identification of intraindividual change
2.  Direct identification of interindividual differences (similarity) in intraindividual change
3.  Analysis of interrelationships in behavioral change
4.  Analysis of causes (determinants) of intraindividual change
5.  Analysis of causes (determinants) of interindividual differences in intraindividual change

From: Baltes and Nesselroade (1979). History and rationale of longitudinal research.

# Basics

-   Longitudinal data: multiple persons measured at multiple time points

-   Longitudinal model: ". . . all repeated measures analyses should start with the question,"What is your model for change?""

-- McArdle (2009). Latent Variable Modeling of Differences and Change with Longitudinal Data

# SEM Perspective

- Structural Equation Models express relationships among observed and latent variables
- Implement estimation of many General Linear Modeling techniques:
  - t test family
  - multiple regression
  - (repeated measures) ANOVA
  - mixed-effect models
  - path analysis
  - mediation models
  - factor models

# Path diagrams

# Difference scores

-   Classic within-person research questions in educational and psychological research concerns a comparison of pre- and post-scores
-   Difference scores are simply the difference between two scores

# The (un)reliability issue

Assume, we have two scores $X$ and $Y$ and form a differences score $D=X-Y$, the reliability of the difference score is:

$$\rho_D = \frac{\rho_{XX'}+\rho_{YY'}-2\rho_{XY}}{2-2\rho_{XY}} $$

with

$\rho_{XY}$ being the

## Common pitfalls

Regression to the mean

```{r}
N <- 2000
set.seed(1234)
x1 <- rnorm(n=N, mean=100, sd = 15)
x2 <- rnorm(n=N, mean=100, sd = 15)
tibble(x1,x2)%>%ggplot(aes(x=x1,y=x2))+geom_point()

ids <- which(x1 <= 70)

tibble(x1,x2) %>% filter(x1<=70) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=x2))+geom_density()
```
